## Introduction

Hi and welcome to the Meme Generator course. In this course we will use and learn about Python, working with JSON data, ChatGPT, editing images using code, and building an interface using Streamlit. At the end of this course you will have a fully functional Meme Generator with a frontend that will generate memes 3 at a time, based on any text or topic you give it.

In order to become the Master of Memes, we will go through 4 steps in total:

- In the first lesson we will look at the template Meme images, fonts, and data we need. We'll also write functions to load up the data so we can work with it.
- In part 2 we'll integrate ChatGPT into the project, look in detail at crafting good system instructions, and use JSON mode to receive structured responses back from ChatGPT.
- Part 3 is where we implement the image editing logic that will combine the empty template images with the text to be embedded at exactly the correct position, color, and size.
- In the 4th and final part we will put it all together, funneling the responses from ChatGPT into our image editing logic, and then building a Streamlit frontend to display the memes!

I hope you're excited to get started. Let's dive right in!
